== Welcome to AnnounceIt!

AnnounceIt is a Ruby on Rails application for hosting teaser pages and
collecting email addresses. It was designed by John W. Long and implemented
by Adam I. Williams.

== License

AnnounceIt is released under the MIT license and is copyright (c) 2009
John W. Long and Adam I. Williams. A copy of the MIT license can be found
in the LICENSE file.

== Installation and Setup

AnnounceIt is a traditional Ruby on Rails application, meaning that you can
configure and run it the way you would a normal Rails application. There are a few things you should know about /this/ app:

1. Review config.announce settings in each environment file

2. If you don't plan to support multiple teasers, signup for an account at
http://yourrootdomain.com/signup?key=dk3su29sw. Make your teaser have the
subdomain of www.

3. If you don't want the www subdomain, try making your teaser use a custom
domain, and you may have to change WelcomeController.

== Support

We don't provide any. Use at your own expense ;)
